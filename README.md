# Optimizing-Reforestation-CONAFOR
Developed a mathematical model for the National Forestry Commission of Mexico (CONAFOR) to optimize the transport logistics for a reforestation program in Mexico. Using techniques like the Traveling Salesman Problem and heuristics, we minimized delivery times and costs, improving efficiency across multiple sites.
