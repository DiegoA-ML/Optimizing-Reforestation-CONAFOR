# Optimizing-Reforestation-CONAFOR

In this project, a mathematical model was developed to optimize transportation logistics in a large-scale reforestation program for the National Forestry Commission of Mexico (CONAFOR). The goal was to minimize delivery time and costs while considering constraints such as transport capacity, work hours, and plant demand across multiple locations.

Advanced techniques like the Traveling Salesman Problem and heuristic algorithms were applied to plan efficient routes. Tools like GAMS and Python (networkx, numpy) were used for data processing and visualization.

Achieved up to 92.2% efficiency in reducing average distance traveled and improved work efficiency by 93.6% through advanced techniques like the Traveling Salesman Problem and heuristics.
Utilized GAMS and Python for data processing and visualization, enhancing logistical efficiency in reforestation efforts.

This project enhanced my skills in mathematical modeling, data science, and optimization, with real-world applications in sustainability and logistics.
